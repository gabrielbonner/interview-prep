Question 3 - You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money

    and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

    Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, write a function to determine the
    maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
    
    For example:
    f([50, 1, 1, 1])  // 51
    f([50, 50, 1, 1])  // 51
    f([50, 1, 1, 50]) // 100
