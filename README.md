Hi all,

Daniel has designated Thursdays as 'Technical Thursdays', so with that in mind I'm sending two sets of tech interview-style questions for those who want the practice.  Questions 1 and 2 are discussion questions, I recommend practicing it in pairs but it could be to the mirror, a stuffed bear, an empty chair, whatever.  :)  Question 3 is meant to be drawn up on a whiteboard/paper.  Unfortunately people practicing solo won't get the chance to ask questions to the 'interviewer', but either way make sure you drive the interview and talk out loud about what you're doing while you're doing it.  Communication is more important than solving the problem.

Last tip!  Practicing things once doesn't do much good.  Trying this again tomorrow and once more Saturday or Sunday will really help you internalize the knowledge, otherwise you'll barely be scraping the surface of what you can get from this exercise.  Just a word to the wise.  :)

If you want to share your solution, post it as a comment to the repo in question.

Happy practicing!  :)

Gabriel
