Hi there!

You're probably here because you are -or are going to be- looking for a Jr. Web Dev job and want to prepare for the dreaded tech interview.  Fear not, with practice it will get much easier.  With that in mind, this repo contains sets of interview questions that I update every Thursday.

There are two sets of questions, the idea is that you play the interviewer and your partner the interviewee for one set, then switch roles.  That said, if you're short a partner you could always try with a mirror, a stuffed bear, an empty chair, whatever.  :)

Questions 1 and 2 are for general discussion, feel free to ask some follow-up questions as appropriate.  Question 3 is meant to be drawn up on a whiteboard/paper.  Unfortunately people practicing solo won't get the chance to ask questions to the 'interviewer', but either way make sure you talk out loud about _what_ you're doing _while_ you're doing it.  Think of it this way, communication is more important than solving the problem.

Last tip!  They say that practice makes perfect, but in reality practicing things once doesn't do much good.  Trying all this again tomorrow and once more Saturday or Sunday will really help you internalize the knowledge, otherwise you'll barely be scratching the surface of what you can get from this exercise.  Obviously you're a thorough person because you are here reading this, so why not take the step that 95% of people will probably skip and write down 'practice attempt #2' on your calendar for Friday at 2pm?

If you want to share a solution, post it in the comments section.  If you have any feedabck or suggestions for problems, please let me know!  I often wonder if people find these things useful.

Happy practicing, and good luck in the job hunt.  :)

Servus,

Gabriel
