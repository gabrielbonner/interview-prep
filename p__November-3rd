Technical Thursdays
03 November, 2016

Set 1:
Question 1 - Do you do anything in your freetime that helps contribute to your development as a programmer?
Question 2 - What is your favorite language to code in, and why?
Question 3 - Given an array of numbers sorted in ascending order, write a function that will return the first index at which the number is found.  For example -
    array = [1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 15, 15, 22, 31]
    target = 15
    find_index(array, target) #=> 7

Set 2:
Question 1 - In life, are you generally clean and orderly, or messy and chaotic?  How about when you code?
Question 2 - Why do you think the Javascript ecosystem is so large?  In your opinion, is it too large?
Question 3 - Write a function that accepts a multi-dimensional array and returns a one-dimensional version.  For example -
    flatten([1, 2, [3, [4], 5, 6], 7]) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
