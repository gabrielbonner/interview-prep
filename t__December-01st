Technical Thursdays
01 December, 2016

Set 1:
Question 1 - If you were offered the possibility to work remote for part of your workweek, would you take it?  Why/Why not?
Question 2 - What classes and methods are necessary to implement a car using Object Oriented Programming?
Question 3 - Write a function that randomly shuffles an array of letters.  Do not use a built-in method like Ruby's #shuffle, however you may use #rand which will return you a randomized float to the 10th decimal place (for example, 0.2535246418).
  Example:
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    randomize_function(arr)
    #=> [8, 4, 7, 5, 10, 2, 3, 6, 1, 9]

Set 2:
Question 1 - If you were hired at this company, what would your goals be for the first month?  What would you hope to achieve?
Question 2 - What is an immutable object, and can you give some examples when it would be useful?
Question 3 - Write a function that transforms a linked list into a doubly linked list.
