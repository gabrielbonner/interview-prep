Technical Thursdays
1 September, 2016

Set 1:
Question 1 - Why did you get into programming?
Question 2 - What version control systems have you used?  Why are version control systems necessary?
Question 3 - You have nine visualy identical balls.  Eight have the same weight, but one is heavier than the others.  Using a scale, how can you weight them a maximum of 2 times to find the heavier ball?  (I was asked this question at my last interview.)

Set 2:
Question 1 - What separates a junior level programmer from a senior level programmer?
Question 2 - What is string interpolation?  Can you give an example of when you would use it?
Question 3 - Since the first set of questions has a logic puzzle, here's another (once you finish, look up 'Fermi problems' to give you suggestions on how to solve it): Give a rough estimate of how many car mechanics are employed full-time in San Diego.
