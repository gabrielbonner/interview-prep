Technical Thursdays
10 November, 2016

Set 1:
Question 1 - How long do you anticipate being a Jr. developer if we hire you?  When do you think you will be able to work independently?
Question 2 - What IDEs are you familiar with?  Are there any that you prefer?
Question 3 - Write a function that accepts a string consisting entirely of brackets ([](){}) and returns whether it is balanced. Every "opening" bracket must be followed by a "closing" bracket of the same type. There can also be nested brackets, which adhere to the same rule.
  Example:
    f('()[]{}(([])){[()][]}') // true
    f('())[]{}') // false
    f('[(])') // false

Set 2:
Question 1 - Do you think good programmers need to have a high level of intelligence?  Why/Why not?
Question 2 - Imagine that you were asked to recreate Github from scratch.  What framework/tools would you use?
Question 3 - Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.  Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
  Example: 
    S = [-1, 2, 1, -4]
    target = 1
    function(S, target)  // 2
    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
