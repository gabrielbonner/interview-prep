Technical Thursdays
20 October, 2016

Set 1:
Question 1 - What skills are you currently lacking that would make you a better programmer?
Question 2 - What does the 'bang' (!) do in Ruby, and can you give some situations when you would or would not use it?
Question 3 - Time to debug!  :)

The following code is outputting an array with the numbers 0 through 9, but we just want the even numbers.  What's gone wrong?

var evenNumbers = []
var findEvenNumbers = function (i) {
  if (i % 2 === 0)
    console.log(i, 'is an even number, adding to array!');
    evenNumbers.push(i);
}

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  findEvenNumbers(i);
}

console.log(evenNumbers);
// outputs:
// 0 "is an even number, adding to array!"
// 2 "is an even number, adding to array!"
// 4 "is an even number, adding to array!"
// 6 "is an even number, adding to array!"
// 8 "is an even number, adding to array!"
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Set 2:
Question 1 - How would you deal with a difficult co-worker?  Imagine that they tease you because you came from a coding bootcamp and don't have a CS degree, and they often say demeaning things about bootcamps to other people and in front of you.
Question 2 - What is the difference between 'git pull', versus 'git fetch' + 'git merge'?
Question 3 - Time to debug!  :)

The following code is outputting '0', but if 4*4=16 and 2*2=4 then the result should be 12.  Can you fix it?

var square = function (number) {
  result = number * number;
  return result;
}

result = square(4);
result2 = square(2);
difference = result - result2;

console.log(difference);
// 0
